## Overview

**This assignment is part of Module 5 and provides an in-depth exploration of Python functions, including distinctions between functions and methods, function arguments, return statements, lambda functions, iterators, and generators. Each question has been addressed with examples to clarify key concepts.**

## Theory Questions

**The theory questions cover fundamental and advanced topics on functions, with examples for each answer. Here’s a brief outline of what’s covered:**

1. **Difference between Functions and Methods**: Discusses the concept and use-cases for each.
2. **Function Arguments and Parameters**: Explains parameter types with examples.
3. **Ways to Define and Call Functions**: Explores different syntax for defining and invoking functions.
4. **Purpose of the `return` Statement**: Details how to use `return` effectively in functions.
5. **Iterators vs. Iterables**: Explains their distinctions and usage in loops.
6. **Generators in Python**: Provides a foundation on defining generators and their advantages.
7. **Advantages of Generators**: Lists the benefits of using generators over conventional functions.
8. **Lambda Functions**: Describes their syntax and common use cases.
9. **Using `map()`**: Shows how `map()` applies functions to iterable elements.
10. **Difference Between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()`**: Compares each function’s unique purpose and usage.

11. **Sum Operation Internal Mechanism**: *(Note: A written image demonstrating the internal sum operation using the `reduce` function on a sample list will be attached.)*

## Practical Questions

**The practical exercises reinforce understanding through hands-on implementation. Tasks include:**

1. **Sum of Even Numbers**: A function that calculates the sum of even numbers in a list.
2. **String Reversal**: A function that returns the reverse of a given string.
3. **Square of List Elements**: A function that squares each integer in a list.
4. **Prime Number Checker (1 to 200)**: A function to determine if a number within a given range is prime.
5. **Fibonacci Iterator Class**: A custom iterator class to generate Fibonacci sequences.
6. **Power of 2 Generator**: A generator yielding powers of 2 up to a specified exponent.
7. **File Line Reader Generator**: A generator to read lines from a file one at a time.
8. **Tuple Sorter with Lambda**: A lambda-based function to sort tuples by the second element.
9. **Temperature Conversion Using `map()`**: A program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
10. **Vowel Filter Using `filter()`**: A program that removes all vowels from a given string.
11. **Bookshop Accounting Routine**: A program that calculates order totals and applies conditional discounts using `lambda` and `map()`.

## Usage
**Open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells to review theoretical concepts and solve the practical questions. Each code cell includes comments explaining the logic and approach used in the solution.**
